In addition, the attacker must  have write access to a \\nconfiguration file. Alternatively, the attacker could inject a malicious \\nenvironment variable pointing to a malicious configuration file. In both \\ncases, the attack requires existing privilege.\\n\\nCVE-2024-12801: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in SaxEventRecorder by QOS.CH logback version 0.1 to 1.3.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.5.12  on the Java platform, allows an attacker to \\nforge requests by compromising logback configuration files in XML.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe attacks involves the modification of DOCTYPE declaration in  XML configuration files.",

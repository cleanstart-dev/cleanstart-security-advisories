  "details": "CVE-2020-11012: MinIO versions before RELEASE.2020-04-23T00-58-49Z have an authentication bypass issue in the MinIO admin API. Given an admin access key, it is possible to perform admin API operations i.e. creating new service accounts for existing access keys - without knowing the admin secret key. This has been fixed and released in version RELEASE.2020-04-23T00-58-49Z.\\n\\nCVE-2024-24747: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage. When someone creates an access key, it inherits the permissions of the parent key. Not only for `s3:*` actions, but also `admin:*` actions. Which means unless somewhere above in the access-key hierarchy, the `admin` rights are denied, access keys will be able to simply override their own `s3` permissions to something more permissive. The vulnerability is fixed in RELEASE.2024-01-31T20-20-33Z.",

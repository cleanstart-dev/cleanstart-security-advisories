  "details": "CVE-2025-47907: Cancelling a query (e.g. by cancelling the context passed to one of the query methods) during a call to the Scan method of the returned Rows can result in unexpected results if other queries are being made in parallel. This can result in a race condition that may overwrite the expected results with those of another query, causing the call to Scan to return either unexpected results from the other query or an error.\\n\\nCVE-2025-62157: Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows versions prior to 3.6.12 and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.2 expose artifact repository credentials in plaintext in workflow-controller pod logs. An attacker with permissions to read pod logs in a namespace running Argo Workflows can read the workflow-controller logs and obtain credentials to the artifact repository. Update to versions 3.6.12 or 3.7.3 to remediate the vulnerability. No known workarounds exist.\\n\\nCVE-2025-47914: SSH Agent servers do not validate the size of messages when processing new identity requests, which may cause the program to panic if the message is malformed due to an out of bounds read.\\n\\nCVE-2025-4673: Proxy-Authorization and Proxy-Authenticate headers persisted on cross-origin redirects potentially leaking sensitive information.\\n\\nCVE-2025-58181: SSH servers parsing GSSAPI authentication requests do not validate the number of mechanisms specified in the request, allowing an attacker to cause unbounded memory consumption.\\n\\nCVE-2025-54410: Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. A firewalld vulnerability affects Moby releases before 28.0.0. When firewalld reloads, Docker fails to re-create iptables rules that isolate bridge networks, allowing any container to access all ports on any other container across different bridge networks on the same host. This breaks network segmentation between containers that should be isolated, creating significant risk in multi-tenant environments. Only containers in --internal networks remain protected.\\nWorkarounds include reloading firewalld and either restarting the docker daemon, re-creating bridge networks, or using rootless mode. Maintainers anticipate a fix for this issue in version 25.0.13.\\n\\nCVE-2025-32445: Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes. A user with permission to create/modify EventSource and Sensor custom resources can gain privileged access to the host system and cluster, even without having direct administrative privileges. The EventSource and Sensor CRs allow the corresponding orchestrated pod to be customized with spec.template and spec.template.container (with type k8s.io/api/core/v1.Container), thus, any specification under container such as command, args, securityContext , volumeMount can be specified, and applied to the EventSource or Sensor pod. With these, a user would be able to gain privileged access to the cluster host, if he/she specified the EventSource/Sensor CR with some particular properties under template. This vulnerability is fixed in v1.9.6.\\n\\nCVE-2025-8556: A flaw was found in CIRCL's implementation of the FourQ elliptic curve. This vulnerability allows an attacker to compromise session security via low-order point injection and incorrect point validation during Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\\n\\nCVE-2025-62156: Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Versions prior to 3.6.12 and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.2 contain a Zip Slip path traversal vulnerability in artifact extraction. During artifact extraction the unpack/untar logic (workflow/executor/executor.go) uses filepath.Join(dest, filepath.Clean(header.Name)) without validating that header.Name stays within the intended extraction directory. A malicious archive entry can supply a traversal or absolute path that, after cleaning, overrides the destination directory and causes files to be written outside the /work/tmp extraction path and into system directories such as /etc inside the container. The vulnerability enables arbitrary file creation or overwrite in system configuration locations (for example /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/crontab), which can lead to privilege escalation or persistence within the affected container. Update to 3.6.12 or 3.7.3 to remediate the issue.\\n\\nCVE-2025-0913: os.OpenFile(path, os.O_CREATE|O_EXCL) behaved differently on Unix and Windows systems when the target path was a dangling symlink. On Unix systems, OpenFile with O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags never follows symlinks. On Windows, when the target path was a symlink to a nonexistent location, OpenFile would create a file in that location. OpenFile now always returns an error when the O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags are both set and the target path is a symlink.",

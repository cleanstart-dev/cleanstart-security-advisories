An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crash. A similar issue was previously reported as CVE-2024-47535. This issue was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input limit. Commit d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix.",

Specifically HttpURI\n and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an \ninvalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may\n be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI \nis used after passing validation checks.",
